            Early Life: Family and Education
        </h1>
        <p>
            Lalisa Manoban was born 
            and raised in Buriram Province, Thailand. 
            She’s the only child to her parents whose 
            information was not revealed to the public yet. 
            Though details about her biological parents weren’t known, 
            she was raised by her mother and her stepfather, Marco Brueschweiler, 
            a certified Swiss Master Chef based in Thailand where he owns a restaurant.
        </p>
        <p>
            She was educated at Praphamontree II School, a private school in Bangkok. 
            From an early age, Lalisa knew she wanted to pursue a music career and 
            took dance and vocal lessons. Over the years, she has competed in various 
            dance competitions and won several awards, including the Special Team Award 
            at the 2009 LG Entertainment Million Dream Sanan World.

            Now, this is the topic that most of you are probably looking forward to. 
            Lisa, in fact, has no visible relationship ties with anyone and the chances 
            of her having a boyfriend are slim at best because she isn’t allowed to be 
            in a relationship or smoke or drink as long as she’s associated with YG Entertainment, 
            the brain of Blackpink. Although the young beautiful rapper is keen on building her music career, 
            her beauty cannot go unnoticed.
